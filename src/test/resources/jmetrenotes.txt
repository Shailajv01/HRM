############Performance Testing:###########

Performance Testing:
		To test an s/w appln by applying load whether it can withstand under any circumstances.
Load Test:
	To measure the performance under expected load.
Stress Test: 
	To measure the performance under high expected load.
Spike Test:
	By sudden increase in load.
Endurance Test:
	To check the system for expected load for long duration.
Volume Test: 
	To measure performance with high volume of data.
Soak Test:
continues usage of appln 
EX:mobile,T.V


	#####CONTROLLERS#####
            -------------

 Controllers:
	It is container where we add req.
Logic controller:
	This is used to decide "which and how" a req is to be send.
Loop controller:
	This is used "when user want to run a particular req for many times out of several reqs.
Simple ctrl:
	This has multiple users/This controller is just a placeholder for grouping and ordering the different elements of the test plan.


Module ctrl:
	A Req can be runned for multiple times 
                        (or)
         we can reuse a test fragment(e.g. a sampler) into our script again by selecting the module from the Module Controller’s control panel.
	EX: Login module is used for several times login-->registration 
						   login-->Product booking
						   login-->logout
Interleave ctrl:
	To run in sequentail order
        EX:login-->registration-->product booking-->logout

Random ctrl:
	This will take random reqs.
EX:flight booking
 User login
 Admin login         }  Random req can execute either user login or Admin login
 Registration
Flight booking.
			
Run ctrl:
	For a given time period,how many iterations does a req do
If ctrl:
    	This ctrl is executed only when the condition is only true.
While ctrl:
	This ctrl will execute untill the condition is false.
Transaction ctrl:
	This ctrller is used to group sample reqs into one 
Include ctrl:
	By using this ctrller,we can add an external .jmx file.
Recording ctrl:
	This ctrl acts as placeholder where the recording is done using HTTP proxy(Placeholder:-->A person occupies the place of anoter person)

Switch ctrl:
	This ctrl is used to pick any one req for processing from multiple req's based on index position.


Throughput ctrl:
	It is used to ctrl the processing of its child elements in terms of total number of execution (or) % of execuion
mentioned in its ctrl panel.


		####TIMERS####
		-----------------
Timers:
   If we apply load/stress performance without giving delay.The appln may be overloaded and doesnot provide perfect results
Constant Timer:
	All the users will wait at a constant time period a/c to the value you provided(ms)
Uniform Random Timer:
	Samplers wait for a specific time interval for a given values.It should have Constant Time + Random Delay
Gaussain Random Timer:
	 To pause the execution
Synchronization Timer:
	To hold threads untill x- no .of threads arrives and then all are released at a time."This timer will create heavy load on application.


          ######ThreadGroup#####
To put load on an appln
Setup ThreadGroup:
	Before execution that means intilization(creating users)
Teardown ThreadGroup:
	After execution that means deletion
        ########

Latency:
	Time spent on network
Importance: User will use the appln from different locations.so latency is used.
ResponseTime:
	latency+processing time
Importance:It is the time taken by the server to process the Req and send respose.Due to low response time the users will be unhappy.so response time is neccessary.

Bandwidth:
	The max amount of data that can be transferred per unit of time through the comm'n channel.
Throughtput:
	The no.of transactions performed ina second within a given time period.
Correlation:
	To handle dynamic values
Parameterization:
	Passing test data from external files to script.

Regular Expression:
	Sequence of symblos&characters which expresses a string to be searched for within a longer piece of text.
